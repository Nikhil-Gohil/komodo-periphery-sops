# komodo-periphery-sops
Want to enable using sops and age on my komodo deploys. Since I am running Komodo periphery agents inside docker compose, they do not have access to sops and age binaries on the host. Building a komodo periphery image with these included so I have a plug and play replacement to enable a sops workflow for my homelab.
